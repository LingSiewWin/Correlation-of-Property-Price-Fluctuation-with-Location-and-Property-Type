# Correlation-of-Property-Price-Fluctuation-with-Location-and-Property-Type
This project uses R programming to analyse the correlation between property price fluctuation with location and property type.

The analysis of median property prices in selected locations reveals significant disparities. Setapak, Cheras, and Kepong have lower prices, Bukit Jalil, Mont Kiara, and KLCC are mid-range, while Bangsar, Damansara Heights, and Country Heights Damansara are higher. Notably, Country Heights Damansara's prices are about 10 times higher than Setapak's.

The Boxplots illustrate the price variance of property types across selected locations, highlighting key statistical measures like the median, quartiles, and outliers. They reveal that Bungalows and condominiums have significant price fluctuations in high-priced locations, while apartments, flats, serviced residences, and semi-detached houses show more stable pricing. Bungalows in KLCC exhibit the highest price fluctuation, followed by condominiums in KLCC and residential land in Damansara Heights. These findings underscore the impact of property type distribution on price dynamics, supporting prior evidence of location's influence on pricing changes.
